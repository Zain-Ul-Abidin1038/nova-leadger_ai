# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Financial Verification System enhances the NovaLedger AI app with rigorous verification mechanisms for financial calculations and API operations. This system ensures accuracy and traceability by implementing split-step verification for tax deductions and thought signatures for all external API calls, providing users with transparent, auditable financial tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Split-Step Verification for Financial Calculations

**User Story:** As a user, I want all financial calculations to follow a rigorous verification process, so that I can trust the accuracy of my tax deductions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Receipt_Analyzer processes a receipt, THE Verification_Engine SHALL execute three sequential verification steps
2. THE Verification_Engine SHALL identify the Tax_Jurisdiction as the first step with default value US-IRS 2026
3. WHEN the Tax_Jurisdiction is identified, THE Verification_Engine SHALL determine the applicable Deduction_Rule for the expense type
4. WHEN the Deduction_Rule is determined, THE Verification_Engine SHALL calculate the Deductible_Amount and verify it against the rule
5. THE System SHALL record each verification step with timestamp and intermediate values

### Requirement 2: Tax Jurisdiction Identification

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically identify the correct tax jurisdiction, so that appropriate tax rules are applied to my expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Verification_Engine SHALL default to US-IRS 2026 as the Tax_Jurisdiction
2. WHEN identifying Tax_Jurisdiction, THE Verification_Engine SHALL record the jurisdiction code and effective date
3. THE System SHALL make the Tax_Jurisdiction configurable for future multi-jurisdiction support
4. WHEN Tax_Jurisdiction cannot be determined, THE System SHALL use the default and log a warning

### Requirement 3: Deduction Rule Application

**User Story:** As a user, I want expense-specific deduction rules applied correctly, so that my deductible amounts reflect actual tax law.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an expense type is identified, THE Verification_Engine SHALL retrieve the corresponding Deduction_Rule
2. THE System SHALL support deduction rules including: meals (50%), entertainment (0%), travel (100%), office supplies (100%), alcohol (0%)
3. WHEN a Deduction_Rule is applied, THE System SHALL record the rule name, percentage, and source regulation
4. IF no Deduction_Rule matches the expense type, THEN THE System SHALL default to 0% deductibility and flag for manual review
5. THE System SHALL validate that Deduction_Rule percentages are between 0% and 100%

### Requirement 4: Deductible Amount Calculation and Verification

**User Story:** As a user, I want calculated deductible amounts to be verified for accuracy, so that I can rely on the system for tax reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating Deductible_Amount, THE Verification_Engine SHALL multiply the expense total by the Deduction_Rule percentage
2. THE Verification_Engine SHALL verify the calculation by performing a reverse check (Deductible_Amount / percentage = original amount)
3. WHEN verification fails, THE System SHALL flag the calculation as invalid and prevent saving
4. THE System SHALL round Deductible_Amount to two decimal places using standard rounding rules
5. THE System SHALL record both the original amount and Deductible_Amount with calculation metadata

### Requirement 5: Thought Signatures for API Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want every API call to generate a thought signature, so that I can trace and debug failures effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call is initiated, THE System SHALL create a Thought_Signature before execution
2. THE Thought_Signature SHALL capture operation type, timestamp, input parameters, and expected outcome
3. WHEN an API call completes, THE System SHALL update the Thought_Signature with actual result and status
4. THE System SHALL persist Thought_Signature data for all API operations
5. WHEN an API call fails, THE System SHALL include error details and stack trace in the Thought_Signature

### Requirement 6: Thought Signature Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want thought signatures to contain comprehensive operation data, so that I can analyze failures without additional logging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Thought_Signature SHALL include a unique identifier for each operation
2. THE Thought_Signature SHALL record operation_type as a string (e.g., "save_to_aws", "analyze_receipt")
3. THE Thought_Signature SHALL capture input_parameters as a structured map
4. THE Thought_Signature SHALL record expected_outcome as a description of success criteria
5. THE Thought_Signature SHALL capture actual_result including response data or error information
6. THE Thought_Signature SHALL include execution_duration in milliseconds
7. THE Thought_Signature SHALL record success status as a boolean

### Requirement 7: Thought Signature Analysis on Failure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically analyze thought signatures when operations fail, so that I can quickly identify root causes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API operation fails, THE System SHALL retrieve the associated Thought_Signature
2. THE System SHALL compare expected_outcome with actual_result to identify discrepancies
3. THE System SHALL analyze input_parameters for validation errors or malformed data
4. THE System SHALL generate a failure analysis report including likely causes
5. THE System SHALL log the failure analysis for debugging purposes

### Requirement 8: Integration with Receipt Service

**User Story:** As a user, I want receipt analysis to automatically include verification steps, so that I see transparent calculation processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Receipt_Analyzer processes a receipt, THE System SHALL invoke the Verification_Engine
2. THE System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing receipt scanning flow
3. WHEN verification steps complete, THE System SHALL include verification metadata in the receipt record

2. THE System SHALL capture AWS request parameters including ledger name and data payload
3. WHEN AWS sync completes, THE System SHALL update the Thought_Signature with response metadata
4. THE System SHALL maintain existing Safe_Layer functionality without breaking changes
5. WHEN AWS sync fails, THE System SHALL analyze the Thought_Signature and provide actionable error messages

### Requirement 10: Nova Trace Integration

6. THE System SHALL format verification data for readability in the Nova_Trace UI

### Requirement 11: Error Handling and Recovery
