## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Route Configuration
- Profile route exists at `/profile` in `app_router.dart` ✅ (Already implemented)
- Route is accessible from any screen in the app

### TR-2: Design System Compliance
- Uses `GlassCard` for all containers
- Uses `AppColors` constants (no hardcoded colors)
- Follows glassmorphism aesthetic with frosted glass effects
- Neon accents use teal (#00F2FF) and purple (#B388FF)

### TR-3: Code Quality
- No Flutter analyzer errors ✅ (Fixed)
- Uses `withValues()` instead of deprecated `withOpacity()` ✅ (Fixed)
- Follows feature-first architecture pattern
- Uses Riverpod for state management where needed

### TR-4: Navigation Integration Points
- Home screen needs profile/settings button
- Profile button should be accessible but not intrusive
- Consider adding to:
  - Top-right corner of home screen AppBar
  - Bottom navigation (if implemented)
  - Settings section in home screen

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- Profile screen loads in < 500ms
- Navigation transitions are smooth (60fps)
- No jank or frame drops

### NFR-2: Accessibility
- All interactive elements have minimum 44x44 touch targets
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Screen reader compatible

### NFR-3: User Experience
- Consistent with NovaLedger AI's premium aesthetic
- Intuitive navigation patterns
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive to user interactions

## Out of Scope
- Actual implementation of profile editing functionality (placeholder only)
- Real authentication/logout logic (navigates to auth screen only)
- Cloud sync of profile data
- Profile image upload
- Email verification
- Password reset functionality

## Dependencies
- ✅ Profile screen implementation complete
- ✅ Router configuration complete
- ✅ Design system (GlassCard, AppColors) available
- ⏳ Home screen modification needed
- ⏳ Navigation button/icon needed

## Success Metrics
- Users can access profile screen from home in < 2 taps
- Zero navigation errors in profile flow
- Profile screen matches design system 100%
- All acceptance criteria met

## Priority
**HIGH** - Profile/settings access is a standard feature users expect in mobile apps

## Estimated Effort
- Small (1-2 hours)
- Main work: Add profile button to home screen
- Testing: Verify navigation flow
