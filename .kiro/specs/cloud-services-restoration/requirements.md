# Cloud Services Restoration - Requirements

## Overview
Restore cloud AI and backend services to NovaLedger AI after they were previously removed and converted to mock implementations. This includes Nova 3 Pro AI integration and AWS Amplify services.

## Background
The app previously had all cloud services (Google AI/Nova and AWS Amplify) removed and converted to mock implementations for local-only operation. Recent changes show the Nova service being restored with real API integration, indicating a need to properly restore cloud functionality.

## User Stories

### 1. AI-Powered Receipt Analysis
**As a** user  
**I want** to scan receipts and get AI-powered analysis with tax deduction calculations  
**So that** I can accurately track deductible expenses without manual calculation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Receipt images are analyzed by Nova 3 Pro Vision API
- AI extracts vendor name, total amount, tax, and category
- AI calculates deductible amounts based on 2026 tax rules
- AI separates alcohol amounts (0% deductible)
- Analysis includes thought signature for transparency (Ghost Trace)
- Results are displayed within 5 seconds of capture

### 2. Conversational AI Assistant
**As a** user  
**I want** to chat with an AI assistant about my expenses  
**So that** I can get financial advice and answers to tax questions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Chat interface connects to Nova 3 Pro with high-level thinking
- AI maintains context from previous messages
- AI has access to user's financial memory/history
- Responses include thought signatures for transparency
- Chat works in real-time with streaming responses

### 3. Secure Authentication
**As a** user  
**I want** to securely sign in to my account  
**So that** my financial data is protected and synced across devices

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can sign up with email and password via AWS Cognito
- Users can sign in with existing credentials
- Session management keeps users logged in
- Cognito sub (user ID) is captured for data isolation
- Sign out clears all session data

### 4. Cloud Data Backup
**As a** user  
**I want** my receipts and financial data backed up to the cloud  
**So that** I don't lose data if my device is lost or damaged

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Receipts are automatically synced to AWS S3
- Audit trails are stored in S3 for legal compliance
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Users can retrieve historical data from cloud
- Sync happens automatically in background

### 5. Long-Term Financial Memory
**As a** user  
**I want** the AI to remember my financial patterns and history  
**So that** it can provide personalized advice and warnings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Financial events are stored in AWS Bedrock AgentCore Memory
- Memory includes semantic tags (Loan, Owed, Debt, Tax Rule, etc.)
- AI retrieves relevant memories before analysis
- Memory context is injected into AI prompts
- Users can view their stored financial memories

### 6. Graceful Degradation
**As a** user  
**I want** the app to work offline when cloud services are unavailable  
**So that** I can still capture receipts without internet

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- App detects network connectivity
- Local storage (Hive) works without cloud connection
- Receipts are queued for sync when offline
- Mock responses are used as fallback
- User is notified of offline mode

## Technical Requirements

### API Keys & Configuration
- Nova API key must be securely stored (not hardcoded)
- AWS Amplify configuration must be environment-specific
- API keys should support rotation without code changes
- Configuration should be loaded from secure storage

### Performance
- Receipt analysis completes within 5 seconds
- Chat responses stream in real-time
- Background sync doesn't block UI
- App startup time < 3 seconds

### Security
- All API calls use HTTPS
- AWS credentials use IAM authentication
- User data is isolated by Cognito sub
- API keys are never logged or exposed
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest

### Error Handling
- Network errors show user-friendly messages
- Failed API calls retry with exponential backoff
- Offline mode activates automatically
- Errors are logged for debugging (without sensitive data)

## Out of Scope
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Social login (Google, Apple, Facebook)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Custom AI model training
- On-premise deployment

## Dependencies
- Nova 3 Pro API access
- AWS Cognito User Pool
- AWS Cognito Identity Pool
- AWS S3 bucket for audit vault
- AWS Bedrock AgentCore (if available)
- Active internet connection for cloud features

## Success Metrics
- 95% of receipt analyses complete successfully
- Average analysis time < 3 seconds
- 99.9% uptime for authentication
- Zero exposed API keys in production
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: API Key Exposure
**Mitigation:** Use environment variables and secure storage, implement key rotation

### Risk: API Rate Limiting
**Mitigation:** Implement request throttling and caching, use exponential backoff

### Risk: Cloud Service Costs
**Mitigation:** Monitor usage, implement quotas, optimize API calls

### Risk: Network Dependency
**Mitigation:** Implement offline mode, local caching, graceful degradation

### Risk: Data Privacy Concerns
**Mitigation:** Clear privacy policy, data encryption, user consent flows

## Open Questions
1. Should we support multiple AI providers (Nova, OpenAI, Claude)?
2. What's the backup strategy if AWS services are unavailable?
3. How do we handle API key rotation in production?
4. Should we implement request caching to reduce API costs?
5. What's the data retention policy for cloud storage?
